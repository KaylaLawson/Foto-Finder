### Foto-Finder

## Authors:
Kayla Lawson

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla Javascript
This project relied heavily on JavaScript. Created UI with a limited amount of HTML. This was styled with CSS and is responsive for large screens and mobile.


## Project requirements:
Build an photo generator to create photo cards that can be stored, deleted, and favorited. With each photo card being displayed in cards on the webpage, you have the ability to edit after you save a card which gives the user the ability to change the original content.


## Goals:
Provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface which relies on JavaScript, specifically localStorage, to persist photos between sessions.
* Build a responsive client-side application.
* Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage.
* Iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed.
* Give user ability to delete ideas from DOM and local storage.
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness.


## Challenges:
One large challenge introduced in this project was implementing was building the functionality to favorite the card. Also, the UI for displaying if a photo is choosen and visually showing the ablitly to upload was a challenge I never came to solve. 

## Wins:
As this is the first solo project I have done, I am proud of where I got. That is the best win, that I am proud. 


## Wishlist Fixes:
I have listed out the wishes and fixes in the issues portion of the GitHub.
